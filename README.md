This repo will eventually be the door robot that controls physical access to Ardent West.

Right now, it only contains `mifare-desfire-clipper-id.c`

# mifare-desfire-clipper-id.c
As the name implies, this returns the Clipper ID if the card you're trying to scan is a Clipper Card. If the card you are tryign to scan is not a Clipper Card, you get nothing and like it.
